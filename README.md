# Micromark Playground

https://iansan5653.github.io/micromark-playground/

A playground for visualizing [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) GFM token streams. This tool helps visualize how micromark parses Markdown content by showing both the original text and the generated tokens side by side. Created with React/Vite and Copilot.
